                Insight Creative and its team have distinguished themselves by spotting technology trends and thoughtfully assessing whether new channels are a strategic fit for our health care organization. They do a ton of homework. I’ve been consistently pleased by
                their level of preparedness, which has included an impressive ability to impart knowledge as well as anticipate questions.

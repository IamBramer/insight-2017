Move the needle! That was what Goodwill asked Insight to do. Spring clothing sales were lacking due to a slow temperature rise in May prompting Goodwill to add marketing dollars in a month they would not normally advertise. After working with two other media buyers in the market, Goodwill selected Insight to create a program that would help increase retail sales in June. Focusing on TV and online, Insight was able to reach the Green Bay, Appleton, Wausau, Stevens Point, Eau Claire and La Crosse markets—with a very limited budget—and provided over $14,000 in added value to help raise store revenue significantly.

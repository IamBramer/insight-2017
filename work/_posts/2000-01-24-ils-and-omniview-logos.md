Integrated Legacy Solutions (ILS) is a software provider specializing in legacy data conversion and migration. Insight developed the geometric, multicolored ILS logo, signifying data migration, to be used as a standalone or in conjunction with their software product logo, Omniview. The Omniview logo, emulating a camera aperture to convey the product’s viewing capabilities, was designed to stand alone, or to complement ILS’s parent company logo.

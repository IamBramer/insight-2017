In 2011, Insight formed a partnership with the BCHBA with the goal of increasing public attendance at their four annual events: the January Home Show and Tour of Remodeled Homes, the March Spring Showcase of New Homes and the September Fall Showcase of New Homes. Using the same media budget from the previous year, Insight was able to negotiate better placement of ads, gain more added value, coordinate additional ticket giveaways, arrange on-air interviews and introduce a robust social media component. As a result, attendance has increased 32.9% over the last three years!

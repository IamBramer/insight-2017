Located in Sturgeon Bay, Door Peninsula Winery is a locally owned establishment known for producing a large variety of award-winning, fruit-based wines. In an effort to strengthen the branded appearance of Door Peninsula Winery’s 14 grape wines, Insight created new labels within a carefully selected color palette to differentiate each flavor, but retain a consistent look between all grape varieties. The new design features Door County’s landmark lighthouse and distinguished peninsula silhouette printed in an embossed metallic coating on satin paper. The labels achieve a refined and elegant look that not only accurately represents the winery’s brand, but also stands out on grocery shelves.

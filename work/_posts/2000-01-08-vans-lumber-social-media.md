As a family-owned building contractor for over 60 years, Van’s Lumber has built exceptional new custom homes in Door, Kewaunee and Brown Counties. With an active presence on Facebook, Pinterest and Houzz, Van’s is continuously building an online portfolio displaying the interiors and exteriors of their beautiful custom homes as well as communicating monthly specials at their Dyckesville Hardware Store and Design Center. A Van’s photo taken by Insight received national recognition earning the site’s “Best of Houzz” award.

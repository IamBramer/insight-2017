For over 12 years, Insight planned, purchased and placed all paid media for both Ministry and Affinity throughout northeast, central and northern Wisconsin – everything from ads in small high school sports programs to regional initiatives promoting all thirteen hospitals and over 40 clinics. Campaigns featured oncology services, birthing centers, cardiology, orthopedics and more. When St. Elizabeth Hospital in Appleton launched a new state-of-the-art hybrid OR, Insight was able to deliver 1.2 million impressions and 1828 clicks to the website in only four weeks. The result far exceeded the client’s goal for the campaign.
